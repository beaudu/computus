# COMPUTUS: Easter Sunday
## computus.m
This little function computes the date of Easter Sunday for present year or specific years, using Oudin's algorithm. It works for the entire Julian calendar (starting 325 AD) and Gregorian calendar (after 1583 AD). An option allows to use the Western Orthodox Church calendar instead of the default Catholic Church.

Easter day is useful to calculate other Christian feasts, like
*Ash Wednesday* (Easter - 46), *Good Friday* (Easter - 2), *Ascension Thursday* (Easter + 39), *Pentecost* (Easter + 49) and others.

The function might recognize most of the Christian days related to Easter, and understand English and French feast names.
