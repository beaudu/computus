# EASTER: Easter Sunday
## easter.m
This little function computes the date of Easter Sunday for present year or specific years, using Oudin's algorithm. It works for the entire Julian calendar (starting 325 AD) and Gregorian calendar (after 1583 AD).

Easter day is useful to calculate other Christian feasts, like
Ash Wednesday (Easter - 46), Good Friday (Easter - 2), Ascension Thursday (Easter + 39), Pentecost (Easter + 49) and others.

The function might recognise most of the Christian days related to Easter.
